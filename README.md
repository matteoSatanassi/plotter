# plotter
Simple app for cvs file extraction and potting, used during my internship. The task was to plot experiments data, IdVd curves and trap distribution curves, exported in csv files.
The app is very simple, just upload the csv files in the data folder and start the program; it'll plot all of them and save the figures in the output folder. A couple of input file examples has been left for reference. At the start the program will ask if the user wants to change some configs in a guided procedure.

### Note
install the python packages written on requirements.txt.
